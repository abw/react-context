# Counter Class Demo

Before `useState` was a thing we used to write classes derived from
`React.Component` and call `this.setState()` to set state variables.

Although this approach is less relevant nowadays for simple state management
tasks, it's still perfectly valid and can be useful when you need to define
more complex state or have lots of functions that might modify the state.
I find myself reaching for this when I need to share state across an entire
web site (e.g. for user authentication or a shopping cart) or in a section
of a web site (e.g. in the behind-the-schemes administration section of a
site for product management, user management, order processing, etc.)

The good news is that you can re-write your functional state component as an
object class and nothing else needs to change.  All of the other code is
identical to the previous example.

Here's the same counter demonstration using this approach.

<Split>
  <Source
    code="<App/>"
    expand
  />
  <App/>
</Split>

Here's the version with the count initially set to 100.  In addition we have
a `debug` property to enable debugging messages.  Watch the Javascript console
for messages as you click on the buttons.

<Split>
  <Source
    code="<App initialCount={100} debug={true}/>"
    expand
  />
  <App initialCount={100} debug={true}/>
</Split>

## `App.jsx`

This is what our application code `App.jsx` looks like. It's identical to the
previous example.

<Source
  code={AppSrc}
  caption="App.jsx"
  expand
/>

## `Counter.js`

The only thing that has changed is the `Counter.js` where the application
state is stored.

<Source
  code={CounterSrc}
  caption="Counter.js"
  expand
/>

We're now defining a `Counter` class to store the state. This extends the
`Context` class imported from `@abw/react-context` in line 1.  You don't have
to extend this base class, but it has the benefit of providing methods of
convenience that your class will inherit.

You can write your own `constructor` method to initialise the object if you
need to.  For most cases you can define `static` properties, as show here
between lines 4 and 13, and allow the base class constructor to take care of
things for you.

The `initialState` defines the initial state of the object, with the `count`
being set to `0`.

The `initialProps` defines the properties that can be passed to the object to
set the state.  In this case, the `initialCount` property can be used to set
the `count` to a value other than `0`, as demonstrated in the second example
above where we start it off at `100`.

The `actions` is a list of methods that should be exposed as actions in the
context.  These can be specified as an array of method names, e.g `['inc',
'dec']`, or using the short-hand form shown here where they're specified using
a single whitespace delimited string, e.g. `'inc dec'`.

Although it can be a bit tedious having to declare which methods you want to
expose, I've found that it's usually preferable to be explicit and avoid
inadvertently exposing any internal methods that aren't for general use.

The remaining three `static` values control debugging. The `debug` flag can
be set here or as a property to enable or disable debugging.  The
`debugPrefix` and `debugColor` are applied to messages sent to the Javascript
console to help make them stand out.

Both `debugPrefix` and `debugColor` can be defined as functions if you want to
generate them dynamically.  They will be called by the constructor and passed
the context properties as an argument.  They should return the appropriate
prefix or color, respectively.

When debugging is enabled (i.e. `debug` is `true`) any calls to `this.debug()`
will be formatted appropriately and sent to the Javascript console.  Otherwise
they are ignored. See lines 16 and 20 in the `inc()` and `dec()` methods for
examples.

The `inc()` and `dec()` methods should be fairly self-explanatory.  They
update the `count` in the state, respectively adding or subtracting the number
passed as the argument, `n`, which defaults to `1`.

As in the previous example, the final line is the important bit.  The
default export on line 25 is where the `Counter` class is wrapped by a call
to the `Generator` function, also imported from `@abw/react-context`.

## Other Components

Using the class is exactly the same as in the previous example, and all of
the components that access this state remain unchanged.
