# Products Demo

This is a more complex example showing how a context might be defined to
manage a product catalogue and allow a user to add items to a basket.
Debugging is enabled for this example so watch the Javascript console for
messages as you click on the buttons.

<App/>

## `App.jsx`

This is what our `App.jsx` application code looks like.

<Source
  code={AppSrc}

We're defining a context in `Products.js` and setting up the
`Products.Provider` around a number of other components.

## `Products.js`

The `Products.js` is where all the fun happens.

<Source
  code={ProductsSrc}
  caption="Products.js"
  expand
/>

In line 11 we define an `initialState` which includes the `ready` flag which
is initially set `false`. We also have an empty list of `products` and an
empty `basket`.

We use the `componentDidMount()` method on line 28 to call the
`loadProducts()` method starting on line 32.  In a real world application this
might be making an API call to load product details, but in this example we're
simulating it with a delay before setting the state to include the sample
products defined at the top of the file.

As well as defining the array of `products` in the state we also build a
`productById` index so we can quickly find a product by its `id`.  We also
clear the `loading` flag and set `ready` to be `true`.

The `selectProduct()` method on line 53 is exposed as an action (see the
`static actions` declaration on line 20).  When called with a product `id`
it fetches the product from the `productById` index and stores it in the
state as `product`.

The `addProductToBasket()` method / action on line 60 takes a product `id`,
fetches the details from the `productById` index and adds it to the basket.
If the item is already in the basket we increment the `count`, otherwise we
set it to `1`.

The `removeProductFromBasket()` method / action on line 75 removes the product
from the basket.

The `emptyBasket()` method / action on line 82 empties the basket.

The `quantityInBasket()` method / action on line 87 returns the basket count
for a particular product `id`, or 0 if it's not in the basket.

The `getRenderProps()` method on line 97 allows us to tailor what we expose
in the context.  By default, everything in the `context` returned by the
`getContext()` method would be exposed as separate items.  This returns the
current state, any methods exposed as `actions` and any properties passed
to the context object (e.g. the `debug` flag).

You can expose them all as separate items, but here we're imposing a bit more
structure and bundling them all up as a single `Products` group.  For
convenience we also expose the list of `products`, any `product` that might
be currently selected, and the `basket`.

## `Layout.jsx`

The `Layout.jsx` component uses the `Products.Consumer` (on line 13) to
subscribe to all those items that the `Products` context exports.  It's not
interested in the `products`, `product` or `basket` but it does need to
inspect the `ready` flag which is accessible via the `Products` passed as a
property (line 4).

The component checks the state of the `Products.ready` flag on line 7.  If
the flag is set (i.e. the products have been loaded) then it renders all of
its child component.  Otherwise it displays a "Loading..." message.

## `List.jsx`

The `List.jsx` component is one of those children. It also uses the
`Products.consumer` and receives the context data as the `Products` property,
as well as the separate list of `products` and any currently selected
`product`.  Note that we chose to expose these items separately as a
convenience, but they are also accessible as `Products.products` and
`Products.product`.

It renders the products as a list of buttons.  Each one has an `onClick`
handler which calls the `Products.selectProduct()` method to select the
product. We compare each one to the currently selected `product` and set the
button colour depending on it being selected or not.

We also add the current count of each product in the basket by calling the
`Products.quantityInBasket()` method.

## `Info.jsx`

The `Info.jsx` component consumes the context data but it is only interested
in the currently selected `product`. If there is one then it displays some
information about the product and renders the `Basket` component. Otherwise
it prompts the user to select a product.

<Source
  code={InfoSrc}
  caption="Info.jsx"
  expand
/>

## `Basket.jsx`

The `Basket.jsx` component also needs access to the context data. To
demonstrate the other way of accessing this data, it uses the `useProducts()`
function, imported on line 2 and used on line 7.

If the currently selected product is in the basket then it renders the
`InBasket` component on line 12. Otherwise it renders the `NotInBasket`
component on line 13.

If the basket contains any items then it also renders a button to empty the
basket (lines 16 to 21). Otherwise it displays a message saying that the
basket is empty, on line 22.

<Source
  code={BasketSrc}
  caption="Basket.jsx"

/>

## `InBasket.jsx`

The `InBasket.jsx` component displays a message telling the user how many of
the currently select product they have in their basket on line 7. It also
displays buttons to add another one to the basket (lines 10 to 15) or to
remove it from the basket altogether (lines 16 to 21).

<Source
  code={InBasketSrc}
  caption="InBasket.jsx"

/>

## `NotInBasket.jsx`

The `NotInBasket.jsx` component displays a message telling the user that they
don't have any in their basket (line 7) along with a button for them to add
it to the basket (lines 10 to 15).

## `useProducts.js`

For completeness, here's the trivially simple `useProducts.jsx` component
that simply re-exports the `Products.Use` function.
