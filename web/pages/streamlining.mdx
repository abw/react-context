# Streamlining Exports

You may find it a bit cumbersome writing things like `Counter.Provider` and
`Counter.Consumer`. I know I do.  Furthermore, the use of `Counter.Use` is
considered bad practice and should be avoided.  In the previous example we
created a simple `useCounter` wrapper around it so that our code could
conform to convention.

But we can do better.

If you need that little extra push over the cliff you can streamline the
exports from your context module to allow the different components to be
imported by name.  It's one louder.

Before we start, let's look at the application we're going to be demonstrating
in this section.  Drag the slider or click on the buttons to change the volume.

<App/>

## `Volume.js`

Here's the code for the context module used by the above application.

The interesting part happens between lines 18 and 25. The `Generator`
function is called on line 18 and the object generated is stored in the
appropriately named `generated` variable. In lines 20 to 23 we deconstruct
that into separate variables, all of which are exported by name. This also
gives us the opportunity to create an alias for the `Use` component on line
22 so that it can be imported as `useVolume`. Then on line 25 we set the
default export to be the `generated` object as usual.

<Source
  code={VolumeSrc}
  caption="Volume.js"
  highlightLines="18,20-23,25"
  expand
/>

You don't have to stop there.  You can always give more meaningful names
to your `Provider` and `Consumer` as well if you want to.

<Source
  code={Volume2Src}
  caption="Volume.js"
  highlightLines="5,6"
  expand
/>

## `App.jsx`

Now our application code can import `Provider` as a named import.

<Source
  code={AppSrc}
  caption="App.jsx"
  highlightLines="5,8,16"
  expand
/>

## Other Components

Our other components can import `Consumer` as a named import.

<div className="grid-1 gap-8">
  <Source
    code={SliderSrc}
    caption="Slider.jsx"
    highlightLines="2,13"
    expand
  />
  <Source
    code={ButtonsSrc}
    caption="Buttons.jsx"
    highlightLines="2,10"
    expand
  />
</div>

Or we can access the context using the `useVolume` named import.

<Source
  code={DisplaySrc}
  caption="Display.jsx"
  highlightLines="2,5"
  expand
/>
