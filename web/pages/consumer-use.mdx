# Consumer or Use?

You may be wondering what the difference is between using the `Consumer`
function to wrap a component that need access to the context and calling the
`Use` function from inside the component.

The short answer is that there's no difference. They both achieve the same
end result in slightly different ways.

## Consumer

I tend to use the `Consumer` approach if I have a simple component that is
only returning an HTML element, i.e. it doesn't require curly braces around
the component body. Here's the `Slider.jsx` component from
our <Link to="/streamlining" text="previous example"/> to demonstrate.

  code={SliderSrc}

  expand
/>

## Use

The `Use` approach requires you to call the function from within your
component. So you'll need to put curly braces around your component body. If
you're doing that already then it's no big deal. But if you're not then
you'll have to explicitly add them.

## Multiple Contexts

If a component needs to access multiple contexts then you can do this using
the `Consumer` approach by nesting them. For example, if a component needs
access to the `Auth`, `Products` and `Basket` components then you can do
this:

<Source
  code={ConsumerSrc}
  caption="ExampleComponent.jsx"
  expand
/>

It's a bit clunky isn't it? In these cases it's usually cleaner to define
named `useAuth()`, `useBasket()` and `useProducts()` functions
(see <Link to="/streamlining" text="Streamlining Exports"/>) and call them
from within the component.

  code={UseSrc}

/>
