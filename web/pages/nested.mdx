# Nested Contexts

It's possible to reuse the same React Context object in different generated
contexts. Here's a demo showing how you can do that.

<App/>

## `App.jsx`

This is what our application code `App.jsx` looks like.

<Source
  code={AppSrc}
  caption="App.jsx"
  expand
/>

## `Context.js`

The first thing we have to do is create a React Context object that we can
share.

<Source
  code={ContextSrc}
  caption="Context.js"
  expand
/>

## `Outer.jsx`

The outer context maintains a `data` object using `React.useState` and
implements a `setItem` function to set the value of an item in that `data`
object.

The call to `Generator` on line 18 passes the `Context` object that we import
from `Context.js` as the third argument. The second argument is the
`defaultState` which we can set to an empty object.

<Source
  code={OuterSrc}
  caption="Outer.jsx"
  expand
/>

<div className="warning alert border mar-t-4">
  <h3>Breaking Change in Version 3!</h3>
  Note that this usage has changed in version 3.  In version 2 the `Generator`
  function expected the `Context` to be passed as the third argument (following
  the default context state passed as the second).

  If you have existing version 2 code written as `Generator(Outer, { }, Context)`
  then you should change it to match the last line in the example above.
</div>

## `Inner.jsx`

The inner context works much the same with a couple of differences. One line
8 it accesses the `setItem()` function provided by the `Outer` context by
making a call to `Outer.Use()`. It aliases that to `setOuterItem`. Then in
its own `setItem()` function it updates its own `data` object and
additionally calls the `setOuterItem()` function to set a data item in the
outer context using the `name` defined as a property.

In the example above we create two nested `Inner` contexts, the first having
the `name` set to `one` and the second being `two`.

<Source
  code={InnerSrc}
  caption="Inner.jsx"
  expand
/>

<div className="warning alert border mar-t-4">
  <h3>Breaking Change in Version 3!</h3>
  Note that this usage has changed in version 3.  In version 2 the `Generator`
  function expected the `Context` to be passed as the third argument (following
  the default context state passed as the second).

  If you have existing code written as `Generator(Inner, { }, Context)` then you
  should change it to match the last line in the example above.
</div>

## `Data.jsx`

The `Data` component simply displays the stringified data in the context.

<Source
  code={DataSrc}
  caption="Data.jsx"
  expand
/>

## `Setter.jsx`

The `Setter` component implements some buttons that call the `setItem()`
function when clicked.

<Source
  code={SetterSrc}
  caption="Setter.jsx"
  expand
/>


Both the `Data` and `Setter` components are consumers of the `Outer` context
(line 10 of `Data.jsx` and line 12 of `Setter.jsx`).

However, both the `Outer` and `Inner` contexts share the same underlying
React Context object that we created in the `Context.js`. This means that the
`Data` and `Setter` components will attach to the closest parent context,
either provided by `Outer` or by `Inner`.
