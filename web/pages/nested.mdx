# Nested Contexts

It's possible to reuse the same React Context object in different generated
contexts.

Why might you want to do that?

When a component accesses a React context, either as a consumer or via a
`use` hook, it will attach to the closest context provider.  If you have
nested contexts that share the same underlying React context object then it
will attach to the innermost one that contains the component.

That means it's possible to "mask" an outer context provider with an inner
one.

Why would you want to do that?

Well, I honestly can't remember.  I wish I could tell you more about this
example, how it works and why I wrote it.  I remember I wanted to do this for
a project, but I forget which one.  I might even have found another way to
work around the issue.

The point is to demonstrate that you can pass an existing `Context` object
as an option to `Generator` as `Generator(..., { context: Context })`.
Then it will reuse that React context instead of creating a new one.

Here's a demo showing how you can do that.

<App/>

## `App.jsx`

This is what our application code `App.jsx` looks like.

<Source
  code={AppSrc}
  caption="App.jsx"
  expand
/>

## `Context.js`

The first thing we have to do is create a React Context object that we can
share.

<Source
  code={ContextSrc}
  caption="Context.js"
  expand
/>

## `Outer.jsx`

The outer context maintains a `data` object using `React.useState` and
implements a `setItem` function to set the value of an item in that `data`
object.

The options that we pass as the second argument to `Generator` on line 18
includes the `Context` object that we imported from `Context.js` as the
`context` option.

<Source
  code={OuterSrc}
  caption="Outer.jsx"
  highlightLines="18"
  expand
/>

<div className="warning alert border mar-t-4">
  <h3>Breaking Change in Version 3!</h3>
  Note that this usage has changed in version 3.  In version 2 the `Generator`
  function expected the `Context` to be passed as the third argument (following
  the default context state passed as the second).

  If you have existing code written as `Generator(..., { }, Context)` then you
  should change it to `Generator(..., { context: Context })`.

</div>

## `Inner.jsx`

The inner context works much the same with a couple of differences. One line
8 it accesses the `setItem()` function provided by the `Outer` context by
making a call to `useOuter()`. It aliases that to `setOuterItem`. Then in
its own `setItem()` function it updates its own `data` object and
additionally calls the `setOuterItem()` function to set a data item in the
outer context using the `name` defined as a property.

In the example above we create two nested `Inner` contexts, the first having
the `name` set to `one` and the second being `two`.

<Source
  code={InnerSrc}
  caption="Inner.jsx"
  highlightLines="9"
  expand
/>

<div className="warning alert border mar-t-4">
  <h3>Breaking Change in Version 3!</h3>
  Note that this usage has changed in version 3.  In version 2 the `Generator`
  function expected the `Context` to be passed as the third argument (following
  the default context state passed as the second).

  If you have existing code written as `Generator(..., { }, Context)` then you
  should change it to `Generator(..., { context: Context })`.
</div>

## `Data.jsx`

The `Data` component simply displays the stringified data in the context.

<Source
  code={DataSrc}
  caption="Data.jsx"
  expand
/>

## `Setter.jsx`

The `Setter` component implements some buttons that call the `setItem()`
function when clicked.

<Source
  code={SetterSrc}
  caption="Setter.jsx"
  expand
/>


Both the `Data` and `Setter` components are consumers of the `Outer` context
(line 10 of `Data.jsx` and line 12 of `Setter.jsx`).

However, both the `Outer` and `Inner` contexts share the same underlying
React Context object that we created in the `Context.js`. This means that the
`Data` and `Setter` components will attach to the closest parent context,
either provided by `Outer` or by `Inner`.
