  There are plenty of other excellent tools available for managing state
  in React.  This isn't supposed to be any better or worse, just
  different.  If anything, its simplicity is perhaps the best feature and
  what sets it apart.  If you already know how to use React contexts
  then there's not much else that you need to know to get started
  using it.

## Getting Started

<div className="link">
  See the <Link to="/installation">Installation</Link> page and then the
  <Link to="/overview">Overview</Link> page for a high-level example of use.

## Functional Components

These days <a href="https://react.dev/reference/react/useState">useState</a>
is the preferred way to define stateful variables in React.  This module
provides a simple wrapper function that allows you to convert a component
that defines some internal state into a set of components that make it
possible to easily share that state.  A `Provider` shares
the state and a `Consumer` can consume it.

<div className="link">
  See the <Link to="/simple-counter">Simple Counter</Link> page for a
  demonstration and detailed explanation of the code
</div>

There are some tips on how to streamline your exports.

<div className="link">
  See the <Link to="streamlining">Streamlining Exports</Link> page for
  enlightenment
</div>

And if you're wonder about the different between using `Consumer` and `Use`
then wonder no more.

<div className="link">
  See the <Link to="consumer-use">Consumer vs Use</Link> page for advice
</div>

## Class Based Components

It wasn't that long ago when we had to write classes derived from
`React.Component` to maintain state, and call
`this.setState()` to update the state.

Although this approach is less relevant nowadays for simple state
management tasks, I still find myself reaching for this when I need to
define a more complex state object that needs to provide shared state
for a section of a web site comprising of many pages and components.

There's a `Context` base class that you can extend to create your own state
classes.  It provides various methods of convenience to reduce the amount of
code you need to write.

<div className="link">
  See the <Link to="/counter-class">Counter Class</Link> page for a
  demonstration and explanation of context classes
</div>

The third example shows a slightly more complex case where we have a
product catalogue and a basket that a user can add products to.

<div className="link">
  See the <Link to="/products-demo">Products and Basket</Link> page for the
  more complex example
</div>

## Typescript

If you're using Typescript then there are some more hoops you have to jump
through to make everything type safe.  But you wouldn't be using Typescript
if you didn't like jumping through hoops now, would you?

<div className="link">
  See the <Link to="typescript/functional">Functional Components</Link> page
  for examples of using Typescript with functional components.
