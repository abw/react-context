# Products Demo

This is a more complex example showing how a context might be defined to
manage a product catalogue and allow a user to add items to a basket.
Debugging is enabled for this example so watch the Javascript console for
messages as you click on the buttons.

<App/>

## `App.jsx`

This is what our `App.jsx` application code looks like.

<Source
  code={AppSrc}
  caption="App.jsx"
  expand
/>

We're defining a context in `Products.js` and setting up the
`Products.Provider` around a number of other components.

## `Products.js`

The `Products.js` is where all the fun happens.

<Source
  code={ProductsSrc}
  caption="Products.js"
  expand
/>

There's a lot to take in here.  Let's start by just showing the outline.
We're defining a `Product` class which extends the `Context` imported from
`@abw/badger-context`.  The default export wraps this in a call to `Generator`.

<Snippet
  file="Products/Products.js"
  lineNumbers={false}
/>

Inside the class we first define a number of static items.

<Snippet
  file="Products/Statics.js"
  lineNumbers={false}
  undent={2}
  expand
/>

The `initialState` is, as the name suggests, the initial state that the
class will create.  The `ready` flag is initially set `false`, as is a
`loading` flag which we'll use to indicate when we're loading product data
from a (simulated) API call. We also have an empty list of `products` and an
empty `basket`.

We've then got some debugging options.  The `debug` flag is set to `false`,
but you can enable debugging by passing the `debug` property to the provider.
When it is enabled, the `debugPrefix` and `debugColor` help to make our debug
messages stand out in the Javascript console.

The `actions` defines the lists of methods that we want to convert to callable
functions and add to the context data for child components to call.

We then have a `componentDidMount()` method which calls a `loadProducts()`
method.

<Snippet
  file="Products/Load.js"
  lineNumbers={false}
  undent={2}
  expand
/>

The `loadProducts()` method simulates an API call which would go and fetch
our product catalogue from the server.  Before we do that we set the
`loading` flag to true.  This allows us to visually indicate to the user that
the app is loading some data.

The `sleep()` function imported from `@abw/badger-utils` waits for a second
(to simulate a network delay) before updating the state.  It sets the `ready`
flag to true, the `loading` flag back to `false`, and stores our dummy data
in `sampleProducts` into the state as `products`.  In a real world example,
this would be the data by the server.  We also create a `productById` lookup
table so we can access the data for a particular product using its id.

The `selectProduct()` method is exposed to consumers as a callable function
(see the `static actions` declaration on line 20).  When called with a
product `id` it fetches the product from the `productById` index and stores
it in the state as `product`.

<Snippet
  file="Products/Select.js"
  lineNumbers={false}
  undent={2}
  expand
/>

The next few methods deal with updating the user's basket.  All these methods
are also added to the context model as callable functions.

<Snippet
  file="Products/Basket.js"
  lineNumbers={false}
  undent={2}
  expand
/>


The `addProductToBasket()` method takes a product `id`,
fetches the details from the `productById` index and adds it to the basket.
If the item is already in the basket we increment the `count`, otherwise we
set it to `1`.

The `removeProductFromBasket()` method removes the product
from the basket.

The `emptyBasket()` method empties the basket.

The `quantityInBasket()` method returns the basket count
for a particular product `id`, or 0 if it's not in the basket.

The final method allows us to customise the shape of the data that is added
to the context.

<Snippet
  file="Products/Render.js"
  lineNumbers={false}
  undent={2}
  expand
/>

The `getRenderProps()` method is called by the base class `render()` method.
The default implementation simply forwards the data returned by `getContext()`.
This method returns a single object containing all the state variables (`ready`,
`loading`, `products`, `productById`) and any methods that have been exposed
as callable "action" functions, by virtue of being listed in the static
`actions` (`selectProduct`, `addProductToBasket`,
`removeProductFromBasket`, `quantityInBasket` and `emptyBasket`).

In simple cases this approach works fine.  But in a large application where
you might have multiple contexts in use, it's sensible to impose a little more
structure.

In this example we're keeping all of those items in a single object which
we'll call `Products` (it's sensible but not mandatory to give this the same
name as your context object to avoid confusion).  However, to save consumers
from having to drill down into `Products` to access other commonly used items,
we'll also expose the list of `products`, the currently selected `product`
and the `basket` as separate items.

## `Layout.jsx`

The `Layout.jsx` component uses the `Products.Consumer` (on line 13) to
subscribe to all those items that the `Products` context exports.  It's not
interested in the `products`, `product` or `basket` but it does need to
inspect the `ready` flag which is accessible via the `Products` passed as a
property (line 4).

The component checks the state of the `Products.ready` flag on line 7.  If
the flag is set (i.e. the products have been loaded) then it renders all of
its child component.  Otherwise it displays a "Loading..." message.

## `List.jsx`

The `List.jsx` component is one of those children of the layout component. It
also uses the `Products.consumer` and receives the context data as the
`Products` property, as well as the separate list of `products` and any
currently selected `product`.  Note that we chose to expose these items
separately as a convenience, but they are also accessible as `Products.products`
and `Products.product`.

It renders the products as a list of buttons.  Each one has an `onClick`
handler which calls the `Products.selectProduct()` method to select the
product.

The button color is determined by setting the `className` to `blue` or `grey`.
If the product that we're rendering the button for (in the `products.map`
variable `p`) is the same as the currently selected `product` then we make it
blue.  Otherwise it's set to `grey`.

The text for the button comes from `p.name`.  We also display the quantity
of that product in the basket by calling the `Products.quantityInBasket()`
method.

  code={ListSrc}

## `Info.jsx`

The `Info.jsx` component consumes the context data but it is only interested
in the currently selected `product`. If there is one then it displays some
information about the product and renders the `Basket` component. Otherwise
it prompts the user to select a product.

<Source
  code={InfoSrc}
  caption="Info.jsx"
  expand
/>

## `Basket.jsx`

The `Basket.jsx` component also needs access to the context data. To
demonstrate the other way of accessing this data, it uses the `useProducts()`
function, imported on line 2 and used on line 7 (see below for the source
of this trivial component - it's just an alias for `Products.Use`)

If the currently selected product is in the basket then it renders the
`InBasket` component on line 12. Otherwise it renders the `NotInBasket`
component on line 13.

If the basket contains any items then it also renders a button to empty the
basket (lines 16 to 21). Otherwise it displays a message saying that the
basket is empty, on line 22.

<Source
  code={BasketSrc}
  caption="Basket.jsx"
  expand
/>

## `InBasket.jsx`

The `InBasket.jsx` component displays a message telling the user how many of
the currently select product they have in their basket on line 7. It also
displays buttons to add another one to the basket (lines 10 to 15) or to
remove it from the basket altogether (lines 16 to 21).

<Source
  code={InBasketSrc}
  caption="InBasket.jsx"
  expand
/>

## `NotInBasket.jsx`

The `NotInBasket.jsx` component displays a message telling the user that they
don't have any in their basket (line 7) along with a button for them to add
it to the basket (lines 10 to 15).

## `useProducts.jsx`

For completeness, here's the trivially simple `useProducts.jsx` component
that simply re-exports the `Products.Use` function.
