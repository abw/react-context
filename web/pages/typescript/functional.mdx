# Typescript and Functional Components

Let's look at the Typescript equivalent of the [Simple Counter](../simple-counter)
example.

<Example
  Component={App}
  code={AppSrc}
  caption="App.tsx"
  expand
/>

## Types

There are two types that need to be defined.  One for the provider and one
for consumers.

<Source
  code={TypesSrc}
  caption="Types.ts"
  expand
/>

The first (`CounterProps` in this
example) is for the properties that can be passed into the context provider to
configure it.  In this case, we have just one: an optional `initialCount` to
set the initial value for the `count` state variable.

The second (`CounterRenderProps`) is for the properties that will be passed to
context consumers.  This includes the `count` state variable and the `setCount()`
function used to update it.  Both of these are provided by calling React's
`useState()` hook.

We then have two additional functions: `inc` and `dec` as shortcuts to
increment and decrement the count, respectively

Note the delightfully cryptic type of `setCount`:
`React.Dispatch<React.SetStateAction<number>>`.  As someone who appreciates
simple, readable code, this makes me want to scratch my eyes out.  You
can import the `SetState` type alias and use that instead if you prefer.

  code={Types2Src}

## Generator

When we create the model function, we type it using the `ContextType` generic
type, specifying the `CounterProps` and `CounterRenderProps` types as the
generic type parameters.  We then wrap the component using the `Generator`
function and return the result as the default export.

<Source
  code={CounterSrc}
  caption="Counter.ts"
  highlightLines="5,20"
  expand
/>

Alternately, you can combine the two and define the model function inline
in the call to `Generator`.  In this case you don't need the `ContextType`
generic type and can specify `CounterProps` and `CounterRenderProps` as
generic type parameters on `Generator`.

<Source
  code={CounterAltSrc}
  caption="Counter.ts"
  highlightLines="5,20"
  expand
/>

## Consume

Components that consume the context properties should type their properties
with the `CounterRenderProps` type.  Here's a component which displays the
current count.

<Source
  code={CountSrc}
  caption="Count.tsx"
  highlightLines="4"
  expand
/>

If you want your consumer components to accept other properties then you
should define a type for them.  For example, you might want the `Count`
component to accept an optional `name` property which defaults to `count`,
but allows you to set a different value.  The properties should be typed
as a intersection of the generic `CounterRenderProps` that all consumers
receive and your specific type for this component which is `CountProps` in
this example.

<Source
  code={CountNameSrc}
  caption="Count.tsx"
  highlightLines="4-6,8"
  expand
/>


If you define your function inside the call to `Counter.Consumer` then the
properties will be typed automatically.  Typescript is smart enough in this
case to infer the property types.

<Source
  code={ControlsSrc}
  caption="Controls.tsx"
  highlightLines="4"
  expand
/>


If you have additional properties that you want the component to accept then
you should define a type for them and pass it to `Consumer` as a generic
type parameter.

<Source
  code={ControlsStepSrc}
  caption="Controls.tsx"
  highlightLines="3-5,7"
  expand
/>

## Use

If you're using the `Use` hook to access the context properties then the values
returned will automatically be typed.  As discussed in previous examples, hooks
like this should be of the form `useSomething`.  To keep things simple for
this example, we'll define an alias on line 4 and then use it on line 7.

<Source
  code={BignumSrc}
  caption="Bignum.tsx"
  highlightLines="3,6"
  expand
/>

You can define any additional properties to the component in the usual way.
In this example we don't need to define a type for the properties as `size`
has a default `string` type which Typescript can infer automatically.

<Source
  code={BignumSizeSrc}
  caption="Bignum.tsx"
  highlightLines="5"
  expand
/>
