# Typescript and Class Based Components

Things get a little bit more complicated when using class components with
Typescript.  If you're writing a new context from scratch then writing it as
a [functional component](functional) might be the best bet.

That said, there are still some benefits to be had from using class based
components.  If you've got an existing class based component that you don't
want to rewrite then migrating it to Typescript isn't *too* difficult. But
there are a few things you need to be aware of if you want to maintain full
type safety.

This example is the Typescript equivalent of the
[Counter Class](../counter-class) example which defines a model class which
extends the `Context` base class.  We'll start off by making it "Just Work"
and then we'll look at some of the deeper issues relating to full type
safety.

<Example
  Component={App}
  code={AppSrc}
  caption="App.tsx"
  expand
/>

## Types

We need to define three types for this.

<Source
  code={TypesSrc}
  caption="Types.ts"
  expand
/>

The first is the `CounterProps` which are the same as in the previous example.
These are the properties which can be passed to the provider for initial
configuration.  We're using the `ContextProps` utility type to wrap the
properties.  This creates an intersection with `ContextDebugOptions` which
define the debugging options that the base class `Context` accepts.

If you prefer you can write it like this:

<Source
  code={TypesDebugSrc}
  caption="Types.ts"
  expand
/>

The second is `CounterState` which defines the properties that the class can
store in its internal state.

The third is `CounterActions` which defines the methods that will be bound as
callable functions and passed to consumers.  This is controlled by the
`actions` state item.  In this example there's an element of type unsafety
which we will look at improving in the next section.

The final type is `CounterRenderProps` which is the intersection of the
previous three.  This usually isn't required as it's generated automatically,
but we've included it here because some of the following code snippets depend
on it.


## Generator

We then define a class which extends the base class `Context`, passing the
`CounterProps`, `CounterState` and `CounterActions` types as generic
type parameters.  Each of these types are optional.  The fourth implicit
type, not shown here, is equivalent to `CounterRenderProps`.  The default
value is an intersection of the first three.  If you want to pass additional
properties to your consumers then you'll need to add them to your definition
of `CounterRenderProps` and pass that as the fourth generic type parameter.

There are three static items that are related to the types.  The `initialState`
on line 10 defines the default state for the class.  This should have the same
type as `CounterState`.

The `initialProps` on line 14 is used to set the state from the props.  In this
example the `count` state variable can be set by the `initialCount` property.
The keys should be properties in your `CounterState` and the values should be
in `CounterProps`.

The `actions` on line 18 lists the methods that should be converted to callable
functions and passed to consumers.  These correspond to the `CounterActions`
type.

Note that these items are where we start to lose type safety.  There's some
funky magic going on in the base class which takes advantage of Javascript's
dynamic nature.

The other static items shown here enable debugging and set the debug prefix and
color.  Check out the Javascript console to see the debugging messages.

Finally we have the definitions for the `inc` and `dec` methods.

The final step is to wrap this in the `Generator()` function and return the
result as the default export.

<Source
  code={CounterSrc}
  caption="Counter.ts"
  highlightLines="4-8,10,14,18,35"
  expand
/>

## Consumer

Here's the `Count.tsx` component.  This is provided access to the context
via the `Consumer()` wrapper function.  The properties should be typed as
`CounterRenderProps`.

<Source
  code={CountSrc}
  caption="Count.tsx"
  highlightLines="4"
  expand
/>

If you define the function inside the call to `Context.Consumer` then you
don't need to worry about declaring the types of the properties.  Typescript
will be able to infer that automatically.  If you make use of this then you
generally don't need to define `CounterRenderProps` explicitly.

<Source
  code={ControlsSrc}
  caption="Controls.tsx"
  highlightLines="4"
  expand
/>

As we saw in the previous [Functional Components](functional) example,
additional properties can be defined for a component if necessary.
The properties should by typed with an intersection of `CounterRenderProps`
and the additional properties as show here.

<Source
  code={ControlsStepSrc}
  caption="ControlsStep.tsx"
  highlightLines="4-6,8"
  expand
/>

Or if you define your component inside the call to `Counter.Consumer` then
you just need to add the type for additional properties as parameter to
the `Consumer` generic.

<Source
  code={ControlsStep2Src}
  caption="ControlsStep.tsx"
  highlightLines="3-5,7"
  expand
/>


## Use

If you access the context properties via the `Use` hook then Typescript will
be able to infer the property types automatically.

<Source
  code={BignumSrc}
  caption="Bignum.tsx"
  highlightLines="6"
  expand
/>
