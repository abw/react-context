# Class Components and `defaultProps`

If your class component uses `defaultProps` to provide default values for
your properties then you've got a problem.

Typescript [has supported the use of `defaultProps`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/release-notes/typescript-3-0.html#support-for-defaultprops-in-jsx)
since version 3, but it only really works inside the class component.  It
also requires you to mark your properties as being required, even though
they're not.

Consider this example which works correctly but confuses Typescript.
The `initialVolume` property is marked as being optional because a default
value is provided by `defaultProps`.  However typescript will complain when
you try to use `this.props.initialVolume` to set the `volume` state variable
on line 19. It thinks it might be undefined because it's an optional property,
even though we can clearly see that it will always be defined by virtue of the
`defaultProps`.

<Snippet file="typescript/Amplifier1.tsx" expand/>

To "fix" this problem, the Typescript documentation says we should remove the
optional marker (`?`) from the property type.

<Snippet file="typescript/AmplifierProps.tsx" expand/>

It works inside the context class and the previous Typescript error is silenced.
But it's just created another problem.  When you try to use your context
provider you'll get a Typescript error telling you that you forgot to include
the `initialVolume` property.  This is because the provider is using the
`AmplifierProps` to type check the `Provider` and according to that, the
`initialVolume` property is mandatory.

There are no simple solutions that I can find or come up with, despite many
hours wasted randomly mashing away at the keyboard like a demented monkey.

The best I could come up with were a number of sub-optimal workarounds.
If anyone has any better solutions than these then I'd love to hear them.

### Workaround 1

The first option is to move `defaultProps` out of the class into a regular
constant object (lines 1-3 below).  Set the type for those properties to be
optional (line 6) and defensively code around any places where you access
those properties to fall back on your `defaultProps` (line 19).

<Snippet
  file="typescript/AmplifierWorkaround1.tsx"
  highlightLines="1-3,6,19"
  expand
/>

### Workaround 2

Another option is to do a little extra work up front and define something
like `this.config` that contains a combination of the `defaultProps` and
`props`.  This is shown in the example below.

<Snippet
  file="typescript/AmplifierWorkaround2.tsx"
  highlightLines="5-11,17,21-24,26,29-34"
  expand
/>

To be able to type it properly you'll need to split your props
type into two separate types: one for all the properties that are in
`defaultProps` (`AmplifierDefaultProps` on lines 5-7) and one for those that
aren't (`AmplifierRegularProps` on lines 8-10).  Combine them into a single
type (`AmplifierProps` on line 11) to use for the Context props.

Then inside your class object you can type `config` as the intersection of
the regular property type (`AmplifierRegularProps`) and a `Required` version
of the type for the default props (`AmplifierDefaultProps`), as shown on line
17.

Then you can define `this.config` to be a combined spread of `defaultProps`
and `props` (lines 21-24).  Now you can safely access `this.config.initialVolume`
on line 26 and Typescript will be able to tell that this value is always
defined as a number.

One thing to bear in mind: if your properties are likely to change then you
should implement a `componentDidUpdate()` method to re-generate `this.config`
from the new set of `props` (lines 29-34).

### Workaround 3

If you find that all to be a bit messy then another approach is to define a
single type for your props and use the `WithRequired` utility type to
selectively convert the relevant values from optional to required.

<Snippet
  file="typescript/AmplifierWorkaround3.tsx"
  highlightLines="1,8-12,23,32,33"
  expand
/>

The `WithRequired` utility type is used to convert the
two optional properties, `initialVolume` and `initialColour` in the
`AmplifierProps` on lines 8-12, into required properties for `this.config`
on line 23.

Once again, you can then safely use the values in `this.config` on lines
32 and 33 without fear of Typescript getting all up in your shit.  See the
note in the previous workaround about the possible need to add a
`componentDidUpdate()` method.  It's not included in this example for the
sake of brevity.

### Workaround 4

If you've got a lot of default properties then it can be a bit tedious
(and potentially error prone) to explicitly list all the keys in the
`defaultProps` when you call `WithRequired`.

A better approach in this case is to use the `WithRequiredFrom` utility
type that allows you to pass the `typeof defaultProps` as the second
argument and it will extract all the relevant keys.

<Snippet
  file="typescript/AmplifierWorkaround4.tsx"
  highlightLines="1,9"
  expand
/>

### Caveat

If you use one of the workarounds shown above then be warned that moving the
`defaultProps` out of the class means that they won't automatically be
forwarded to your consumers.

If you're only using the `defaultProps` inside the class then that's probably
not a problem.  But if you're defining default values that your consumers will
rely on then you need to add a custom `getRenderProps` function which exposes
them.

Something like this:

  file="typescript/AmplifierWorkaround5.tsx"
  highlightLines="11-15"
