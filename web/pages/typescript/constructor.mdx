# Class Components and `constructor`

If your class component has a `constructor` method then you'll need to type
the `props` that are passed to it.  The type for the properties is an
intersection of your component's props, state and actions, along with a
generated `render` prop.

The `ContextConstructorProps` utility can be used to take care of it for you.
Specify the props, state and actions as type parameter and it'll construct the
correct composite type.
