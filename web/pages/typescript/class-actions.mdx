# Class Component Actions

One of the nice things about the base class `Context` is that it provides
shortcut functionality to make life easier.  For example, if you define a
static `actions` member then it will automatically bind all the methods
it lists as callable functions.  These are stored in `this.actions` and
automatically added to the context data passed to consumers.

We saw an example of this in [the previous example](class-based#generator)
where we defined `actions` to be `inc dec` to automatically expose the
`inc` and `dec` methods to consumers.

The problem with this is that it relies on Javascript's dynamic nature and
maps those methods at runtime.  This is bad because it means those methods
aren't typed.

In this section we'll look at how to fix that.  But first, let's look at
what we're going to build.

<App/>

And this is what the source code looks like.

## Context Model

Here's the code for our context model.

It's similar to previous examples with a few differences.  We now define an
`AmplifierActions` type in lines 13 to 18.  Then we override the base class
`initActions()` method in lines 37-44 and manually bind the relevant methods.
There's no shortcut alternative to this, as far as I know.  The benefit of
this more long-winded approach is that Typescript can correctly infer the
types of the bound methods and check that the object we return matches the
`AmplifierActions` type.

## Controls Component

We can now consume these action functions in our components and they will
be type checked.  This is the code for the `Controls` component which renders
the buttons to change the volume.  If you try and pass a string to
`setVolume()`, for example, you'll get a Typescript error telling you that it
expects a number, not a string.

## Volume Component

There's not much to say about the `Volume` component, but here it is for
completeness.
