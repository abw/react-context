# Simple Counter Demo

This is a simple example showing how a context can be defined and used.
First, let's see it in action.  Click on the buttons to change the
count.

<Split>
  <Source code="<App/>" expand/>
  <App/>
</Split>

Here's another version with the count initially set to 100.

<Split>
  <Source code="<App initialCount={100}/>" expand/>
  <App initialCount={100} debug={true}/>
</Split>

## `App.jsx`

This is what our application code `App.jsx` looks like.

<Source
  code={AppSrc}
  caption="App.jsx"
  expand
  highlightLines="8,16"
/>

Between lines 8 and 16 we define a `Counter.Provider` which
provides the shared state for any components contained within it.

Let's look at each component in turn.

## `Counter.js`

This is the `Counter.js` where the application state is
stored.

<Source
  code={CounterSrc}
  caption="Counter.js"
  expand
/>

In line 5 the `Counter` component uses the `useState` hook to define a `count`
state variable and `setCount` function to update it.

The `initialCount` property can be passed to the component to set the initial
value for `count`.  Otherwise it defaults to `0`.

We then define two handler functions `inc` and `dec` on lines 6 and 7 to
increment and decrement the `count`, respectively.  They can be passed a
number `n` which defaults to `1`.

So far this is all standard React code.  Where it gets interesting is the
`return` value from the component between lines 9 and 11. We return the result
of calling the `render()` function that has been passed to the component as a
property on line 4.

We pass an object to the `render()` function containing the `count` state
variable and the `inc` and `dec` functions.  We also forward the `setState`
function to allow other components direct access to modify the `count`
variable.

So where does the `render` property come from? The final line is the important
bit.  The default export on line 14 is the `Counter` component wrapped by a
call to the `Generator` function, imported from `@abw/react-context` in line
2.  This turns our simple component that maintains its own state into a
context object that can be used to share that state with any number of other
components.

The `Generator` function returns an object containing `Context`, `Provider`,
`Consumer`, `Children`, and `Use` components.

The `Context` is the React context object.  You probably won't ever need to
use this, but it's provided just in case you do.

We've already seen the `Provider` in use in our `App.jsx`.  This is how we
provide access to the context for any components contained within it.

The other components in our application demonstrate how the `Consumer` and
`Use` items can be used.

## `Count.jsx`

The `Count.jsx` shows how the `Consumer` can be used to get access to the
context.

<Source
  code={CountSrc}
  caption="Count.jsx"
  expand
/>

The default export of the `Count` component is wrapped in a call to
`Counter.Consumer`.  This ensures that all the context state variables (just
`count` in this example) and any exposed action function (`inc` and `dec`, not
used in this component) are provided as properties to the component.

## `Controls.jsx`

The `Controls.jsx` component also uses the `Counter.Consumer` to get access
to the `inc` and `dec` action functions.

<Source
  code={ControlsSrc}
  caption="Controls.jsx"
  expand
/>

## `Bignum.jsx`

The `Bignum.jsx` component takes a different approach which tends to be
preferred these days.

<Source
  code={BignumSrc}
  caption="Bignum.jsx"
  expand
/>

Instead of wrapping the exported component in a call to `Counter.Consumer`,
it calls the `Counter.Use()` function which, provides access to the context
state and actions.

## `useCounter.js`

The `useCounter.js` file simply re-exports the `Use` function for the sake of
convention.  It allows us to use the `useCounter()` function to access the
context which is a little less clunky than `Counter.Use()`.

<Source
  code={UseCounterSrc}
  caption="useCounter.jsx"
  expand
/>

The `Bignum.jsx` module could then be written as:

<Source
  code={Bignum2Src}
  caption="Bignum.jsx"
  expand
/>
