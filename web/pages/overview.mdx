# Overview

This page gives a quick high-level overview of how it all works.  The
[Simple Counter](simple-counter) page goes into more detail if you want
to dig deeper.

## A Simple Counter

Here's a simple example of a component that maintains some state.  It
has a `count` state variable, initially set to `0`, a `setCount` function to
update it, and two functions of convenience: `inc` and `dec` to increment
and decrement the count respectively.

<Example
  Component={State}
  code={StateSrc}
  expand
/>

## What's the Problem?

This works well for simple cases, but as our component (or application) gets
more complicated, we might want to split things up into separate components.

We don't know (and ideally, shouldn't care) what these child components are
doing.  But that means that we can't tell (without looking at the code) which
of the `count`, `setCount`, `inc` or `dec` items they might need.

As the component structure gets more deeply nested it can results in lots of
properties being passed down the component tree so they can use them or pass
them on to their children, grand-children, and so on.

This problem, known as "prop drilling", is something that is nicely solved by
use a React context.  The idea is that you define them in a context and provide
a way for the the child components to fetch them when they need them.

If you're not already familiar with React Context then now would be a good
time to go and read up on it:
[Passing Data Deeply with Context](https://react.dev/learn/passing-data-deeply-with-context).

The purpose of this `react-context` library is to make the process of using a
context as simple as possible.  It doesn't add any core functionality that
isn't already provided by React Context.  It just makes it easier to use.

## Generator

Here's how it works.  We define a component that maintains the state as
before.  We call this a *model* component because it implements the data
model.

Crucially, this component is only responsible for maintaining the
state and does not deal with rendering any content.  Instead it delegates
that task to a `render()` function that is passed into it.

We use the `Generator` function to create a higher-order component from the
model component.  This is what is returned as the default export from the
file (line 14).  The generator effectively creates a wrapper around the
model component that adds the context functionality for you so that you
don't have to worry about it.

The component will now be passed the `render` function (line 4).  All the
model component has to do it call that function and return the result
(lines 9-11).  Any properties passed to the `render` function will be stored
in the context and available to child components.

## Provider

When you import this component from `Counter.js` you  get an object with
three properties: `Provider`, `Consumer` and `Use`.

In your app you should use the `.Provider` property to define a context
provider around the part of your application that needs access to the context
data.

/>

## Consumer

Then any components enclosed within the scope of the provider can access
the context data.  One way is to use the `.Consumer()` function
to wrap the component.  It will then be passed all the context model data
as properties (`count`, `setCount`, `inc` and `dec` in this example).
This component only uses `count`, but the other properties are there if you
need them.

<div className="grid-1 gap-8">
  <Source
    code={CountSrc}
    caption="Count.jsx"
    highlightLines="9"
    expand
  />
</div>

## Use

The generator also creates a `.Use()` function to access the context.  This
is the preferred way to access a context in modern React.  As with the
`.Consumer()`, this returns all the context data.  In this example we're
only using `inc` and `dec` but the other properties (`count` and `setCount`)
are there if you need them.

/>

If you're familiar withe React context and other hooks then that might look a
little jarring to you. By convention, hook functions are typically named
`useSomething` rather than `Something.Use`.  There's a way to streamline this
which we'll look at later, but for now let's just create a `useCounter.jsx`
component to expose it for use.

<Source
  code={UseCounterSrc}
  caption="UseCounter.jsx"
  expand
/>

Here's the previous component using that function to access the context.
